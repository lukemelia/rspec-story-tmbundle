Textmate Bundle for RSpec plain text stories

** Forked to support weplay's existing convention for organizing stories and step matchers.

Salient details of the weplay convention:

  /project_root/stories
    |- basic (directory named for a theme)
    |   |- a_story_for_basic.story (extension must be .story)
    |   |- another_basic.story
    |
    |- steps
        |- basic.rb (step matchers are organized in files that match the theme)

Note that no runner files are required.

#include_steps_for (defined in stories/helper.rb).

  module Spec
    module Story
      class StepGroup
        def include_steps_for(name)
          require File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/steps/#{name}")
          step_matchers = rspec_story_steps[name.to_sym]
          warn "WARNING: 0 step matchers found for include_steps_for(:#{name}). Are you missing an include?" if step_matchers.empty?
          self << step_matchers
        end
      end
    end
  end
 

Features:
  * Color highlighting for plain text stories
    * Themes that have been modified to take advantage of this can be found in color_themes/
  * Snippets for plain text stories and step files.  Include story keywords plus webrat snippets.
  * Predefined completions (escape key) for common story keywords.
  * Spellchecking turned on by default for the plaintext stories.
  * Run the current plain text story and display in HTML.  Clickable backtrace and all.
  * Switch between plain text story and corresponding step matcher files.
  * Automatically create template step file with pending steps based on the steps used in the story.

Caveats:
  * Requires RSpec 1.1.4     

TODO:
  * 6/1/2008 4:10AM - If in story file, and are switching to any other file, if a runner file doesn't exist
        - prompt to create it (right now - going to specific step from story file dies if not)
  * Run All Stories command.
  * Run Selected Stories command.
  * (MAYBE) Make running a story more robust to work with any configuration.
  * Refactor to make cleaner and add more specs.
  * When creating all steps for a new file:
    * Don't create duplicate steps
    * Fix first step name bug
  
TODONE:		
  * Improve HTML output to show failing information.
  * If in story file, and step file doesn't exist, and going to specific step - make snippets work correctly
      - currently inserts new step and tag name of step file - steps_for(:Given "blah blah" ...)
  * When in step file - if doing SHIFT-CTRL-OPTION-DOWN - go to first step that match
  * Switch Command
		* Easily switch between a plain text story and it's step matchers file(s).
  * Step Navigation
    * Be able to quickly navigate to the step files that are being used for the current story.
    * Automatically go to the selected step or create it if it does not exist.
